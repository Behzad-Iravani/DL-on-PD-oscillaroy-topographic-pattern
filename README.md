# DL-on-PD-oscillaroy-topographic-pattern
Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) provides a multivariate framework to detect relevant spatio-oscillatory patterns in the data beyond common mass-univariate statistics. Yet, its practical application is limited due to the low interpretability of the results beyond accuracy. We opted to use DCNN with a minimalistic architecture design and large penalized terms to yield a generalizable and clinically relevant network model, which was trained based on electroencephalography topography data from a primary sample of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) patients and healthy controls, with and without medication. 

The jupyter notebook shared here contains the script for buliding, traning, corss-validating and testing our 3D-CNN to differentiate Parkinson's Disease patient from healthy control based on the spatio-oscialtory pattern.
