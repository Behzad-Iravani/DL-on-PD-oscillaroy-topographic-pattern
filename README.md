# DL-on-PD-oscillaroy-topographic-pattern
Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) provides a multivariate framework to detect relevant spa-tio-oscillatory patterns in the data beyond common mass-univariate statistics. Yet, its practical applica-tion is limited due to the low interpretability of the results beyond accuracy. We opted to use DCNN with a minimalistic architecture design and large penalized terms to yield a generalizable and clinically relevant network model, which was trained based on electroencephalography topography data from a primary sample of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) patients and healthy controls, with and without medication. Next, we validated the model on another independent, yet comparable dataset, which was unseen to the network. Finally, we applied Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) interpretabil-ity technique to create a localization map exhibiting the key network predictors, based on the gradients of the classification score flowing into the last convolutional layer. Accordingly, our results indicated that a sub-second of intrinsic oscillation power in the beta band over the motor cortex and gamma band over a frontoparietal cluster spanning the frontal and centro-parietal sites, had the largest impact on the network score for dissociating the PD patients from age- and gender-matched healthy controls, across the two datasets. In conclusion, our method enabled us to characterize PD patho-electrophysiology according to the multivariate topographic analysis approach, where both spatial and frequency aspects of the oscillations were simultaneously considered. Moreover, our approach was free from existing pitfalls of common electrophysiological data analysis.
